# WesterBekeCtrl
Control application for WesterBeke Marine Generators (in progress)

This application is based on the Rasperry Pi Pico platform and a 1.4 inch graphical display with four control buttons (GPIO) and a custom made relay control box.
The purpose of this application is to automatimize the pre-heat, start and stop functions of the generator as well as monitor the generators run state in terms of RPM and its line frequency drift.
The user functions is to either start the generator with one single buttom press or set the application in stand-by mode to be stimulated to a start by external means, typically a signal from a battery monitor gadget that alerts a low charge level event.
